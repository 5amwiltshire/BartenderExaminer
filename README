BartenderExaminer

Developed by Joao Martinho (jdmartinho@gmail.com)

This application aims to test the knowledge of cocktail recipes for a soon-to-be bartender.
I've developed this myself, while I was studying for such an exam and had around 150 recipes to know.
The application picks up a pool of recipes and generates a random 32 recipe exam.
Each mistake like not getting one ingredient, stating an incorret ingredient, not
getting the right glass type, wrong quantity, etc will be penalized by 1 point.
If you get more than 20 penalty points you fail. 

version 0.1

- Created a rough skeleton for the application
- Added a cocktails.csv file with some rules that will be described soon
- cocktails.csv file contains 124 recipes
